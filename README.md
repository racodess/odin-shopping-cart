# odin-shopping-cart

This is an active learning exercise from MDN's DOM manipulation article:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents#active_learning_a_dynamic_shopping_list

This project is receiving its own repository because of its potential to be refactored into a full-scale project with UI elements in the near future.

The purpose of this exercise is to create a shopping list where a user can add and delete items using event listeners and embedded JavaScript.
